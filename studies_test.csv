QUANTIFYING EFFECTIVENESS OF TEAM RECOMMENDATION FOR COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT,COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT;KNOWLEDGE GRAPH;MACHINE LEARNING;SOFTWARE TEAM EFFECTIVENESS;TEAM RECOMMENDATION,APPLICATION PROGRAMS;GROUPWARE;KNOWLEDGE GRAPH;SOFTWARE DESIGN;COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT;KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS;MACHINE-LEARNING;SOFTWARE TEAM EFFECTIVENESS;SOFTWARE TEAMS;TEAM CHARACTERISTIC;TEAM CONFIGURATION;TEAM EFFECTIVENESS;TEAM MEMBERS;TEAM RECOMMENDATION;MACHINE LEARNING,"IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS A TEAM-BASED ACTIVITY. THE QUALITY OF THE DELIVERED PRODUCT HIGHLY DEPENDS ON THE TEAM CONFIGURATION. HOWEVER, SELECTING AN APPROPRIATE TEAM TO COMPLETE A SOFTWARE TASK IS NON-TRIVIAL, AS IT NEEDS TO CONSIDER TEAM COMPATIBILITY IN MULTIPLE ASPECTS. WHILE EXTENSIVE LITERATURE INTRODUCED MULTIPLE TEAM RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS, SUCH ALGORITHMS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE SPECIFIC ROLES IN SOFTWARE TEAMS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL SET OF METRICS FOR MEASURING FIVE DIMENSIONS OF A SOFTWARE TEAM’S EFFECTIVENESS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL COLLABORATION, TEAM COHESIVENESS, TEAMMATE INTERACTION, TEAM MEMBERS’ EXPERTISE, AND ROLE EXPERIENCE. FURTHERMORE, WINING EXPERIENCE-BASED SOFTWARE TEAM RECOMMENDATION (WESTREC) IS INTRODUCED TO SOLVE THE SOFTWARE TEAM RECOMMENDATION PROBLEM. WESTREC CONSIDERS MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF TEAM CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL COLLABORATION, TEAM COHESIVENESS, TEAMMATE INTERACTION, PROJECT DESCRIPTION, TEAM MEMBERS’ EXPERTISE, AND ROLE EXPERIENCE. SPECIFICALLY, GIVEN A SOFTWARE PROJECT, A MACHINE LEARNING BASED TEAM SCORING FUNCTION IS USED ALONG WITH THE MAX-LOGIT ALGORITHM TO APPROXIMATE AND RECOMMEND SUITABLE SOFTWARE TEAM CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE GIVEN TASK. WE VALIDATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WESTREC ON REAL-WORLD SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT DATASETS (I.E., ATLASSIAN AND APACHE). FURTHERMORE, WE STUDY THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND PROPOSE A METHOD TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SOFTWARE TEAM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WESTREC OUTPERFORMS STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINE APPROACHES IN THREE OUT OF FIVE GROUPS OF TEAM EFFECTIVENESS METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT TEAM CHARACTERISTICS IN LARGE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS NOT ONLY ILLUSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE TEAM EVALUATION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES BUT ALSO SERVE AS BUILDING BLOCKS FOR POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS THAT INVOLVE AUTOMATIC TEAM FORMATION AND EVALUATION, SUCH AS AUTOMATIC RECOMMENDATION OF RESEARCH COLLABORATORS AND GROUPING PERSONNEL FOR TEAM-BASED PROJECTS. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",Quantitative

BACKGROUND: SCHOLARS INCREASINGLY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TEAMWORK IN COLLABORATIVE WORK ENVIRONMENTS, AND EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT A LACK OF TEAMWORK IS A PROMINENT FACTOR IN MANY REAL-WORLD ACCIDENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS CLEAR THAT SOME PERSONS ARE MORE TEAM ORIENTED THAN OTHERS ARE, THERE ARE FEW INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO ASSESS INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN COLLECTIVE ORIENTATION IN A TEAM CONTEXT. METHOD: WE DEVELOP A SCALE TO MEASURE COLLECTIVE ORIENTATION IN TEAMS, GATHER EVIDENCE ON RELIABILITY AND CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, AND EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COLLECTIVE ORIENTATION PREDICTS TEAM PERFORMANCE. RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE COLLECTIVE ORIENTATION SCALE IS RELIABLE, CORRELATES WITH COGNATE MEASURES, AND PREDICTS PERFORMANCE ON A VARIETY OF TEAM TASKS. CONCLUSION: WE DISCUSS THE ROLE OF COLLECTIVE ORIENTATION IN TEAMS AND THE APPLICATION OF THIS SCALE TO ASSESS AND DIAGNOSE TEAMWORK DEFICIENCIES IN WORK GROUPS. APPLICATION: THIS RESEARCH SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION IN TEAMS. © 2010, HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS SOCIETY.",Qualitative

A HUMAN-AUTONOMY TEAM CONSISTS OF HUMAN AND AUTONOMOUS TEAMMATES WHO COLLABORATE TO ACHIEVE MISSION GOALS. IN THIS CONTEXT, AUTONOMY IS DEFINED AS INCREASINGLY CAPABLE AUTOMATION SYSTEM THAT CAN BEHAVE WITH INTENTION, SET ITS OWN GOALS, AND IS CAPABLE OF RESPONDING SITUATIONS WITH GREATER AUTONOMY AND EVEN WITHOUT HUMAN DIRECTION. IN HUMAN-HUMAN TEAMING SCIENCE, EFFECTIVE TEAMING IS GROUNDED IN TEAM SITUATION AWARENESS, TEAM COGNITION, AND TEAMWORK SKILLS. HUMAN INTERACTION WITH AUTONOMOUS TEAMMATES REQUIRES A DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP OF TASKWORK AND TEAMWORK BETWEEN HUMAN AND AUTONOMOUS TEAMMATES. HUMAN TEAMMATES SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERACT EFFICIENTLY, CONTROL, AND EXERCISE AUTHORITY WITH AUTONOMOUS TEAMMATES. THE INTERACTION METHODS MAY BE DIFFERENT IN HUMAN-AUTONOMY TEAMS COMPARED TO HUMAN-HUMAN TEAMS. THIS WORK AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HUMAN-HUMAN TEAMS AND HUMAN-AUTONOMY TEAMS TO IDENTIFY INTERACTION PARADIGMS THAT ENABLE TEAM EFFECTIVENESS AND COLLABORATION. A LITERATURE REVIEW WAS PERFORMED FOR INTERACTION PARADIGMS IN HUMAN-HUMAN TEAMING, HUMAN-AUTOMATION INTERACTION, AND HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION.

THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION QUALITY ON TEAM PERFORMANCE IN DIGITAL MAIN CONTROL ROOM OPERATIONS,COMMUNICATION QUALITY;HUMAN RELIABILITY ANALYSIS;PERFORMANCE SHAPING FACTOR;TEAM PERFORMANCE;UNSAFE ACT,OPERATORS,"A TEAM OF OPERATORS IS REQUIRED FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT OPERATION, AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE OPERATORS IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE TEAM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OUT TASKS. IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THIS COMMUNICATION THOUGH, AND AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMUNICATION QUALITY AND TEAM PERFORMANCE HAS YET TO BE CLARIFIED, IT HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED TO MOST HUMAN RELIABILITY ANALYSIS (HRA) METHODOLOGIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION AND TEAM PERFORMANCE USING DATA FROM A FULL-SCOPE TRAINING SIMULATOR OF A DIGITAL MAIN CONTROL ROOM (MCR). TWO IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMUNICATION WERE CONSIDERED TO DETERMINE QUALITY: EACH OPERATOR'S ABILITY TO SELF-CONFIRM THE STATUS OF A GIVEN TASK IN A DIGITAL MCR, AND THE TYPE OF COMMUNICATION, AS DIVIDED INTO 1-WAY, 2-WAY, AND 3-WAY BETWEEN OPERATORS. TO MEASURE TEAM PERFORMANCE, THE CONCEPT OF AN UNSAFE ACT WAS EMPLOYED, WHICH IS DEFINED AS A HUMAN ERROR THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT PLANT SAFETY. ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE COMMUNICATION QUALITY AND TEAM PERFORMANCE WERE RELATED TO EACH OTHER. WITH THIS MORE CLEARLY DEFINED RELATIONSHIP, THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CAN BE APPLIED TO RELATED PERFORMANCE SHAPING FACTORS TO IMPROVE HRA. © 2019",Mixed

BACKGROUND NURSES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN CARRYING OUT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. CONTEXTUAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SUCCESS OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. STUDIES THAT INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS ON CHINESE NURSES' PRACTICE IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT REMAIN LIMITED. METHODS A SEQUENTIAL EXPLANATORY MIXED-METHODS DESIGN WAS USED FOR THIS STUDY. A QUANTITATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS USED TO ASSESS THE CONTEXT OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING WAS USED TO RECRUIT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TEAMS. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 356 NURSES FROM TERTIARY TEACHING HOSPITALS; 291 (81.7\%) OF THEM COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES. NURSING MANAGERS AND NURSES (N = 18) WERE PURPOSIVELY SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS; THEIR EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES WERE OBTAINED. RESULTS IN THE QUANTITATIVE PHASE, THE ``MICROSYSTEM'' (MEAN=5.24) AND ``QI TEAM'' (MEAN = 4.97) CONTEXTS WERE REPORTED AS SUPPORTIVE CONTEXTS. THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT WAS WEAK, WITH A MEAN SCORE OF 3.92. IN THE QUALITATIVE PHASE, THREE THEMES RELATED TO THE CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGES EMERGED: (1) NURSES' ATTITUDES AND SATISFACTION, (2) TEAM EFFICACY, AND (3) ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CULTURE. CONCLUSIONS EFFORTS TO ELEVATE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND REWARD SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED IN CHINESE HOSPITALS. FURTHER EDUCATION AIMED AT INCREASING SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE PROVIDED, TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTATION. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT DURING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES, MANAGEMENT TASKS SHOULD FOCUS ON INCREASING NURSES' SATISFACTION, SOLVING SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE DEFICITS, AND CLARIFYING NURSES' ROLES IN RELATION TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.",Mixed

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH- TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS, DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 350 MEMBERS OF 35 DIFFERENT TEAMS BY USING CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS TO DISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SHARED LEADERSHIP, TEAM TRUST AND TEAM PERFORMANCE THAT BOUNDED BY TEAM DIVERSITY. FINDINGS- RESULTS SHOWED POSITIVE LINK BETWEEN SHARED LEADERSHIP AND TEAM PERFORMANCE AND FINDING ALSO SHOWED HOW TEAM TRUST MEDIATES SHARED LEADERSHIP AND TEAM PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP. FURTHERMORE, MODERATING EFFECT OF TEAM DIVERSITY IS ALSO EXAMINED IN OUR STUDY. OUR RESEARCH BRINGS IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE AREA OF SHARED LEADERSHIP AND PROVIDES CLEAR FUTURE DIRECTION. SHARED LEADERSHIP CAN BE INCREASED IN ORGANIZATIONS BY FOCUSING ON TEAM TRUST. ORIGINALITY/VALUE- THE NOVELTY OF THIS PAPER EXISTS IN INCLUSION OF TEAM DIVERSITY AS MODERATION EFFECT BETWEEN TEAM TRUST AND TEAM PERFORMANCE.",Quantitative

GIVEN THIS CONTEXT, WE HYPOTHESIZE HOW HIGH FAMILY-FIRM PERFORMANCE IS AFFECTED BY THE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE (EI) OF A FAMILY-BASED CEO AND TOP-MANAGEMENT TEAM (TMT), IN ADDITION TO THE CEO'S TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP (TFL) AND TMT'S BEHAVIORAL INTEGRATION. SURVEY MEASURES WERE TAKEN FROM A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 72 CEOS OF GERMAN FAMILY FIRMS AND 245 MEMBERS OF THEIR TMTS. WE FOUND THAT TMT BEHAVIORAL INTEGRATION MEDIATES BETWEEN CEO TFL AND OBJECTIVE FIRM PERFORMANCE WHILE CEO EI IS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO BOTH CEO TFL AND TMT EI. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED FOR FUTURE RESEARCH THEREBY SUGGESTING AN EXTENSION TO UPPER-ECHELON THEORY.",Quantitative
COLLECTIVE FORAGING: EXPERIMENTALLY INCREASED COMPETITION DECREASES GROUP PERFORMANCE EXPLOITING A PERMANENT RESOURCE,AGGRESSION;COMMON WAXBILL;FOOD AVAILABILITY;FOOD PREDICTABILITY;FORAGING EFFICIENCY;GROUP BEHAVIOUR;SOCIAL TOLERANCE,SOCIAL NETWORK;INFORMATION;EVOLUTION;SIZE,"FORAGING COLLECTIVELY OFFERS ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS ACCESS TO SOCIAL INFORMATION ON FOOD LOCATIONS, BUT IT MAY ALSO INTENSIFY COMPETITION FOR LOCAL RESOURCES. SOCIAL INFORMATION MAY BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS DURING ECOLOGICALLY CHALLENGING CONDITIONS, WHEN FOOD SOURCES ARE SCARCE OR UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH PREDICTS MORE COLLECTIVE FORAGING DURING SUCH CONDITIONS. ALTERNATIVELY, HIGHER WITHIN-GROUP COMPETITION WHEN RESOURCES ARE SCARCE MIGHT DESTABILIZE SOCIAL GROUPS AND REDUCE COLLECTIVE FORAGING. TO EVALUATE THESE EFFECTS, WE EXPERIMENTALLY DECREASED THE NUMBER AND PREDICTABILITY OF FOOD SOURCES (FEEDERS WITH AD LIBITUM SEEDS) AVAILABLE TO WILD-CAUGHT COMMON WAXBILLS ESTRILDA ASTRILD LIVING IN A LARGE OPEN-AIR MESOCOSM. COMPARED TO CONTROL PERIODS, IN THE TREATMENT WITH FEW FOOD SOURCES COMPETITIVE AGGRESSIVENESS AT FEEDERS INCREASED, THE SOCIAL NETWORK BECAME MORE FRAGMENTED, WITH ON AVERAGE WEAKER ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, AND FORAGING GROUPS BECAME SMALLER. FORAGING GROUPS ALSO SPENT LESS TIME PER VISIT TO THE FEEDING AREA, INDIVIDUALS SPENT LESS TIME AT THE FEEDERS PER GROUP VISIT AND HAD TO MAKE MORE VISITS TO THE FEEDING AREA PER DAY, ALL OF WHICH INDICATE LESS EFFICIENT EXPLOITATION OF THE FOOD SOURCES. THESE EFFECTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED WHEN THE NUMBER OF FEEDERS CHANGED UNPREDICTABLY ACROSS DAYS. EVEN THOUGH THE COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF WAXBILLS APPEARED TO EXACERBATE, RATHER THAN MITIGATE, THE ECOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF REDUCED OR UNPREDICTABLE FOOD SOURCES, WE SUGGEST THAT, IN NATURE, THIS INCREASED AGGRESSIVENESS AND FRAGMENTATION OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK MAY FUNCTION ADAPTIVELY AS AN EARLY TRIGGER TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE FORAGING LOCATIONS BEFORE LOCAL FOOD SOURCES ARE SEVERELY DEPLETED.
